# Programmable Power-Supply
The goal of this project is to design and develop a DC-DC buck-boost programmable power supply which has CC CV and programmable voltage modes

This repository include/will include, schematics, assembly instructions, design, related calculations, and code to make the supply work.

## Current Progress:

- Discreet stage : The supply is currently implemented as a buck boost regulator with CC CV capabilities entirely using discreet ICs like basic logic gates and oscillators like NE555

- Embedded Stage : This stage will completely digitize the control and also provide programmable capability along with support hardware.
